svnwatch is a simple python script to watch given svn repositories and send emails with commit message and diffs.

It needs:
	- python3
	- pysvn
	- a temp folder to generate diffs
	- a folder to store the previous state in a file

I might add a verbose mode later.

Oh, and also That's my first python script, so if you see anything just tell me.
